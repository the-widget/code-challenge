# CyrusCodeChallenge

Welcome to my solution of the Cyrus Code Challenge! I packaged my solution into a gem, allowing you to simply install the gem and run it from your command line.

Enjoy!

## Installation

Install with the command:

    $ gem install cyrus-code-challenge

## Usage

Type `cyrus-code-challenge` in your command line to run gem.

Use the numbered menus to navigate:
- Type `exit` or `quit` at anytime to exit the program.

## Usage(cont.)

If you prefer not to install the gem:
    
    - Download the file
    - navigate to the root directory and run:

      $ ruby bin/cyrus-code-challenge

If you prefer to execute without using the CLI:

    - Download the file
    - navigate to the root directory and run:

      $ ruby bin/test-output
